## Tell It Who to Favor

EG I asked: 

Let’s assume the terms of that contract favored the seller. In that case, what terms would differ from a completely balanced contract for the sale of a used car between individuals in the state of California?

ChatGPT replied: 

If the terms of the contract favored the seller, there may be several differences from a completely balanced contract for the sale of a used car between individuals in the state of California. Some examples include:

* A higher sale price for the car, with less negotiation room for the buyer
* Fewer warranties or guarantees provided by the seller regarding the condition of the car
* More limitations on the buyer's ability to cancel or return the car after purchase
* A shorter timeframe for the buyer to inspect the car before purchase
* More favorable terms for the seller in the event of a dispute, such as a requirement for the buyer to go through arbitration rather than taking the seller to court
* Less disclosure from the seller about any known issues or defects with the car
* More restrictive terms for buyer when it comes to the use of the car, for example, forbidden to use the car for commercial purposes

It is important to note that, regardless of whether the terms favor the buyer or the seller, a contract for the sale of a used car between individuals in the state of California should be in compliance with the California Vehicle Code and any other relevant laws, regulations and any other legal requirement.

Conversely, I asked to favor the buyer

Let’s assume the terms of that contract favored the buyer. In that case, what terms would differ from a completely balanced contract for the sale of a used car between individuals in the state of California?

If the terms of the contract favored the buyer, there may be several differences from a completely balanced contract for the sale of a used car between individuals in the state of California. Some examples include:

* A lower sale price for the car, with more negotiation room for the buyer
* More comprehensive warranties or guarantees provided by the seller regarding the condition of the car
* More favorable terms for the buyer when it comes to canceling or returning the car after purchase
* A longer timeframe for the buyer to inspect the car before purchase
* More favorable terms for the buyer in the event of a dispute, such as the right to take the seller to court
* More detailed disclosure from the seller about any known issues or defects with the car
* Fewer restrictions on the use of the car by the buyer, for example, allowing the use of the car for commercial purposes
* More protection for the buyer in case of a lemon law

As I mentioned earlier, regardless of whether the terms favor the buyer or the seller, a contract for the sale of a used car between individuals in the state of California should be in compliance with the California Vehicle Code and any other relevant laws, regulations and any other legal requirement.

## Tell it What to Prioritize 

Using "personae" is one great way to efficiently proxy certain priorities you want to achieve. Do this by including a phrase like "act as a senior partner at a large marketing company specializing in public brand building for top law firms" when drafting a press release or twitter campaign.  

For example, for help on a draft dispute negotiation strategy, do you want to steam roll the other side or, if perhaps the relationship with the other side is deep, long term, and strategic, do you want a more "win-win" approach? 

EG: I asked:


If I ask you to write a legal dispute negotiation strategy in the style of an experienced senior litigation partner at a top 10 law firm how would it be different from writing it in the style of a world renown mediator?

ChatGPT replied: 

If you asked me to write a legal dispute negotiation strategy in the style of an experienced senior litigation partner at a top 10 law firm, the strategy would likely have a more aggressive and assertive tone, focusing on leveraging the firm's resources and legal expertise to achieve the best outcome for the client through litigation. The strategy would likely emphasize the importance of gathering and presenting strong evidence, and making persuasive arguments to the court. It would also likely include a focus on identifying and exploiting any weaknesses in the opposing party's case, and utilizing legal precedents to the client's advantage. The strategy would also likely focus on putting pressure on the opponent through legal actions, such as motions and discovery.

On the other hand, if you asked me to write a legal dispute negotiation strategy in the style of a world-renowned mediator, the strategy would likely have a more conciliatory and collaborative tone, focusing on finding common ground and a mutually-beneficial solution for both parties. The strategy would likely emphasize the importance of active listening and effective communication, as well as identifying and addressing the underlying interests and concerns of both parties. It would also likely include an emphasis on maintaining a neutral stance and fostering an open and respectful dialogue between the parties. The strategy would also likely focus on finding a mutually agreed upon solution without the need for court intervention.

It's also worth noting that, while the senior litigation partner's strategy might be more focused on winning the case through litigation and obtaining the best outcome for the client, the mediator's strategy is more focused on resolving the dispute in a way that is fair and beneficial for both parties through negotiation and mediation. The senior litigation partner's strategy might be more adversarial and focused on the legal aspect, while the mediator's strategy is more cooperative and focused on the parties' interests.


You.com replied this to the same prompt:

Writing a legal dispute negotiation strategy in the style of an experienced senior litigation partner at a top 10 law firm would be different from writing it in the style of a world renown mediator in that the former would focus on the goal of achieving a favorable outcome for the client, while the latter would emphasize the need to find a resolution that meets the needs of both parties.

The senior litigation partner would likely focus on strategies to win the case, such as gathering evidence, developing legal arguments, and leveraging the law to their advantage. Additionally, the senior litigation partner would be prepared to go to trial if necessary, and would advise the client on the best course of action to take.

The world renown mediator, on the other hand, would emphasize the need to reach an agreement that is fair and balanced for both parties. The mediator would focus on strategies to create an environment of mutual understanding and respect, and to foster meaningful dialogue and negotiation. The mediator would also be prepared to use mediation techniques, such as active listening and reframing, to help the parties find common ground.
